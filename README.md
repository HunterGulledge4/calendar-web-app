##### About Schedulify
Schedulify is a fully web-based calendar app designed to help users, particularly students and individuals with ADHD, manage their weekly tasks and boost productivity. Using our “Productivity Funnel” approach, users categorize tasks (e.g., “School,” “Work,” “Home”), assign them to specific days, and then organize them into an hourly schedule for optimal time management. This step-by-step process helps users achieve both personal and professional balance.
